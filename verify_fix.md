# Sets Add/Remove Fix Verification

## Changes Made

### Problem
When clicking the remove button in CreateTemplateView, it would reset to 1 set. Adding from 1 set would allow max 2 sets before resetting. The issue was caused by:
1. SwiftUI view identity confusion with enumerated arrays in ForEach
2. All buttons in the ForEach being triggered simultaneously when the array mutated

### Solution Applied
Changed the ForEach implementation from using enumerated arrays to direct iteration with stable set IDs:

**Before (problematic):**
```swift
ForEach(Array(exercises[exerciseIndex].sets.enumerated()), id: \.element.id) { setIndex, set in
    // ...
}
```

**After (fixed):**
```swift
ForEach(exercises[exerciseIndex].sets, id: \.id) { set in
    let setIndex = exercises[exerciseIndex].sets.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == set.id }) ?? 0
    // ...
}
```

### Key Improvements
1. **Stable View Identity**: Using set IDs directly prevents SwiftUI from confusing views when the array mutates
2. **Proper Button Scoping**: Each button action is now properly scoped to its specific set
3. **Safety Checks**: Added validation to ensure set exists before removal
4. **Prevent Last Set Removal**: Added guard to maintain at least 1 set

## Testing Instructions

1. Build and run the app
2. Navigate to Templates → Create New Template
3. Add an exercise
4. Test the following scenarios:
   - Click "Add Set" multiple times - should add sets incrementally
   - Click remove button on any set (except when only 1 remains) - should remove only that set
   - Rapidly click add/remove - should behave predictably without resets
   
## Expected Behavior
- Adding sets should increment count: 3 → 4 → 5 → 6...
- Removing sets should decrement count: 6 → 5 → 4 → 3...
- Minimum 1 set should always remain
- No unexpected resets or jumps in set count

## Debug Logging
The debug logger is still in place to track operations. Use the "Show Logs" button in the toolbar to view detailed operation logs if issues persist.
